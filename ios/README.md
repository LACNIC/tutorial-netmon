# IOS Folder

GNS3 runs Cisco IOS images (most 7200 and 3700 are supported, 
not much else). However, I cannot distribute the IOS image used 
to run this tutorial.

You can ask your Cisco parter to see whether you qualify to obtain an 
IOS image to use with GNS3.

Future versions of this tutorial will remove this dependency.
